## About Me

I am currently a Postdoctoral Associate at the University of Pittsburgh (US), working on human Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) at the <a href="https://www.rnel.pitt.edu/">RNEL</a>, on a <a href="https://www.snf.ch/en/XIZpfY3iVS5KRRoD/funding/careers/postdoc-mobility">Postdoc.Mobility grant</a> from the Swiss National Science Foundation.

In 2025, I will start a tenured faculty position (ISFP) at the <a href="https://www.inria.fr/en">INRIA</a> in Strasbourg (FR), working on closed-loop non-invasive neurostimulation.

I obtained my PhD in the <a href="https://physiologie.unibe.ch/~pfister/group/">Theoretical Neuroscience Lab</a> of the University of Bern (CH): my main research topic was the development of statistical inference and Bayesian Active Learning methods, and their application to synaptic recordings.

In my previous life, I was an engineer in the space industry: I am currently the Chief Scientist of <a href="https://lide.space/">LIDE Space</a> (a non-profit organizing parabolic flights for microgravity research), and successfully failed twice to become an astronaut. I remain fascinated by anything that flies and makes a lot of noise (to this, someone once answered "so you study, like, seagulls?" This question still haunts me).

I sometimes write on Stack Exchange, especially about <a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/271601/camille-gontier">statistics</a> and <a href="https://academia.stackexchange.com/users/123985/camille-gontier">academia</a>.

## Research Interests

I would define myself as a theoretical neuroscientist, with a keen interest for developing quantative solutions to biological problems. My main research interest is optimal closed-loop control, and its application to neuroscience:
- I developed an efficient algorithm for closed-loop Bayesian Active Learning and applied it to synaptic inference during my PhD project (<a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011342">PLoS CB paper</a>);
- My current postdoc project is about the detection and correction on-the-fly of errors during motor control tasks with BCIs (<a href="https://github.com/camillegontier/camillegontier.github.io/blob/main/assets/files/poster.pdf">COSYNE 2024 Poster</a>);
- Our INRIA team will work on efficient closed-loop neurostimulation and its application to cognitive disorders (<a href="https://mlms.icube.unistra.fr/index.php?title=Presentation
">INRIA team description</a>).

On my free time, I also enjoy studying space sciences, and help with the organization of microgravity experiments.
